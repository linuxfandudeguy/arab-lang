Welcome to **arab-lang**, an esoteric programming language where the syntax is entirely in Arabic! This language is designed for experimental and creative purposes rather than practical application.

## Overview

**arab-lang** is a unique, Arabic-syntax-based programming language that is intentionally minimalistic and experimental. It allows you to create programs using Arabic keywords and expressions. As an esoteric language, it embraces creativity and exploration over traditional programming stability and performance.

## Features

- **Arabic Syntax**: Write code in Arabic.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports fundamental operations, arithmetic, and basic JSON handling.
- **Easter Eggs**: Fun features like the Zen of `arab-lang` and quirky behavior with certain commands.

## Current Status

**arab-lang** is a work in progress and intentionally designed to be small and buggy. It is far from perfect and is expected to have many quirks and limitations. 

**Important**: This language is in an experimental phase, and its features and behavior are subject to change. Regular updates are anticipated as development continues.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/linuxfandudeguy/arab-lang.git   
   cd arab-lang
   ```  
 Or if you are more of an SSH fellow:
  
 ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:linuxfandudeguy/arab-lang.git
   cd arab-lang
   ```

2. **Run the Interpreter**:
   ```sh
   python interpret_arab_lang.py <your-file.arab>
   ```

   Make sure your files have a `.arab` extension.

## Usage

Create a file with the `.arab` extension and write your code using Arabic syntax. For example:

```python

```
